# CoveStack

"""
CoveStack is a platform that I started building this Fall to help solve a struggle that I and so many other students face. Essentially when students work on a project, they usually struggle with switching between many tools (like Google Docs, Slack, a code editor, and so on) and this breaks their workflow and makes the experience more unpleasant. So I decided to bring all of these tools to one place which makes the entire process more seamless and accessible for people working on projects. I built the platform using AI and full-stack development and although the journey wasn’t easy it definitely taught me to keep pushing myself and I hope to use this platform to help so many students.
